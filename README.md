# simple_skin
Code Version Description

Version 1.0
 - Project name: skin1
 - Create time: 31.10.2016
 - Complete time：20.12.2016
 - Description: this version is very similar as ankus’ Matlab code, all the code is based on script so it is easy to understand and fully capable of developing simple applications, but it is very difficult to expansion and re-development of complex applications.

Version 2.0 
 - Project name: skin2
 - Create time: 02.02.2017
 - Complete time:15.04.2017
 - Description: based on the first version I have changed all the script code to functions, so that the code can easy to call, and during the development I improved and added a lot of new functions.

Version 3.0
 - Project name: skin3
 - Create time: 01.05.2017
 - Complete time: 07.05.2017
 - Description: I rewrite the code based on object-oriented method. Many failed methods and redundant functions are removed. All functions are integrated into three classes(preprocess, calculate features and classifier), which have better scalability and robustness. When you develop new applications only need to extend these three classes, and then according to your application's special requirement to rewrite and expand the three class of methods.
